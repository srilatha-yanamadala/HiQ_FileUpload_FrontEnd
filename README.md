## Pre-requisites:

    Install VSCode or any other code editor

    Clone the repository in VSCode

    Install Node

    Install Axios

        npm install axios --save

    Install bootstrap

        npm install bootstrap --save

    Make sure that the Backend API is up and running.

    Also, in the FileUploadAndProcess.js file, the port number and URL should match the Backend API's URL and port number.

    for eg: https://localhost:5001/Home/ReadAndProcessFile
    

## To Run the application:

    npm start

It will open http://localhost:3000 in the default browser.

Also, if any chages are done in the React code, for eg: Components or css etc.., it will reload automatically.

No need to run npm start again, after code changes, as it will automatically pickup the changes.

## Pre-requisites:

    Install VSCode or any other code editor

    Clone the repository in VSCode

    Install Node

    Install Axios

        npm install axios --save

    Install bootstrap

        npm install bootstrap --save

## To Run the application:

    npm start

It will open http://localhost:3000 in the default browser.

Also, if any chages are done in the React code, for eg: Components or css etc.., it will reload automatically.

No need to run npm start again, after code changes, as it will automatically pickup the changes.

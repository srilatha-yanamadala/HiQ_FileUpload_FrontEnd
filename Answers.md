1.  How much time did you end up spending on this coding test?

    Spent almost 2.5 days to finish both Front end and backend api applications. It is not a continuous effort though.

    This is because, I was attending Azure cloud classes in Lexicon IT currently and I had to read and prepare those concepts also simultaneously to cope up with the trainer.

2.  Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution.

    For Backend:

        I have chosen .net mvc as the backend API provider, as I got recently trained in it and i feel comfortable with it.

        I know that are many ways to create a backend API, for eg:  Java backend, Node JS or PHP, but I am not aware of these technologies yet.

    For Front end:

        There are 2 ways to create the front end

            1. Create the front end directly in the C# .net mvc application as a View.

            2. Write another application using Simple HTML5, CSS and JS or use any libraries like React or Angular. I choose React, as it is a widely used library currently.

        Also, It feels like a full stack development approach as well.

3.  What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

    If I have more time, I want to learn and write tests to both Front end and Backend.

        For Front end application, I tried using react test library, but not done fully.

        For Backend .net API, I still need to learn, how to write tests for it.

    Frankly, I had copied some code snippets like CSS, from Google, stackoverflow etc.., instead of reading documentation :), due to less time.

4.  What did you think of this recruitment test?

    It is really good approach to test the candidates.

    People usually learn technologies by writing sample code or follow some video tutorials.

    But these kind of tests, shall help to improve our coding skills and confidence as well.
